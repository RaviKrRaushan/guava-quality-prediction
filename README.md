# üçè Guava Quality Prediction Web App

A Flask-based deep learning web application that predicts guava quality (**Fresh, Mid, Rotten**) from **images** and **video frames** using CNN models and ensemble learning.

---

## üìå Abstract
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify guavas into three categories: *Fresh, Mid-quality, and Rotten*.  
The system integrates **ensemble learning techniques** for improved accuracy and provides a user-friendly **Flask web app** for real-time prediction.  
It aims to assist farmers, vendors, and industries in automating fruit quality assessment, ensuring better pricing, reduced waste, and increased efficiency.

## üéØ Objectives
- Automate guava quality classification from images and video frames.
- Train and compare multiple deep learning models (VGG16, MobileNet, custom CNN).
- Apply **ensemble learning (hard and soft voting)** to enhance performance.
- Deploy a lightweight **Flask web app** with real-time prediction.

## üî¨ Methodology

### Research Design
![Research Design](images/research_design.png)

- Data collection and preprocessing (image frames of guava samples).
- Model training on CPU and GPU with transfer learning.
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Web app deployment for real-time use.

### Ensemble Learning Techniques
![Hard Voting](image/Ensemble Model using hard voting.PNG)
![Soft Voting](image/Ensemble Model using soft voting.PNG)

- **Hard Voting**: Majority class prediction.  
- **Soft Voting**: Weighted probability-based prediction.  
- Ensemble models outperformed individual CNNs in accuracy and generalization.
